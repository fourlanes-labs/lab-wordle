## Introduction

Until this point, the repos you've had to fork for your assignments have been setup to allow you to focus on the particular lessons. This assignment will be different, challenging you to set up you development environment from the ground up.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo.
- Clone this repo.

<br>

## Submission

- Upon completion, create a Pull Request so that your coaches can check your work.
- While you're required to only create a pull request for your main branch, you're expected to create feature branches as you work to demonstrate your understanding of the GitHub workflow.
